2's complement of a binary number is 1, added to the 1's complement of the binary number. In the 2's complement representation of binary numbers, the MSB represents the sign with a '0' used for plus sign and a '1' used for a minus sign.
The ones' complement of a binary number is the value obtained by inverting (flipping) all the bits in the binary representation of the number.
Suppose we're working with 8 bit quantities (for simplicity's sake) and suppose we want to find how -28 would be expressed in two's complement notation. First we write out 28 in binary form.
00011100
Then we invert the digits. 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0.
11100011
Then we add 1.
